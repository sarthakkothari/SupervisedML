# Linear Regression with Regularization

Multiple predictors trying to predict 1 continuous variable

The python file describes implementation of various forms of Gradient Descent using different Regularization techniques functions vs the analytical solution <br/>
We then compare the perfomances.

We also train a model on a real dataset and compare different feature selection techniques (Lasso vs Ridge vs Subset selection)
